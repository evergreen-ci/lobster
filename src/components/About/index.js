    <p>
  Lobster is a log viewer implemented as a React-based frontend.  It also includes a node based backend to view local log files or cache the results locally.
    </p>
    <p> Lobster can: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>search any bookmarked or filtered lines by regexp (the &quot;Find&quot; button). If the regexp finds multiple occurrences in the same log line, it will only count one, but it will highlight them all. As of now, it will also not scroll to the right if the matching text is off screen.</li>
      <li>apply multiple regexp filters to the log lines returned by the backend (the &quot;Add Filter&quot; button)</li>
      <li>enable and disable filters</li>
      <li>match or inverse match filters</li>
      <li>cache the recently accessed files locally to improve load time. It can be set with the --cache if running Lobster locally</li>
      <li>view locally-stored log files. If running Lobster locally, the option --logs sets the absolute path that is available to the server for read server command line argument</li>
      <li>double click on a line number to bookmark (or unbookmark) that line and click on that number on the left-hand side to scroll to it.</li>
      <li>click on the &apos;wrap&apos; toggle to turn line wrapping on and off</li>
      <li>the JIRA text area displays text you can copy into a JIRA ticket to properly format all bookmarked lines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>

   To run Lobster locally follow the <a href="https://github.com/evergreen-ci/lobster/tree/master">readme</a>. To query the local server instead of logkeeper, append <b>?server=host:9000/api/log</b> to the url.
    </p>
    <p>
   Lobster is an easy to extend system. Feel free to make changes: here is the <a href="https://github.com/evergreen-ci/lobster/tree/master">source</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
   NOTE: Lobster only renders the logs on the screen. As a result, the browser&apos;s &quot;find&quot; functionality only searches the current window. Use lobster&apos;s find feature instead.
